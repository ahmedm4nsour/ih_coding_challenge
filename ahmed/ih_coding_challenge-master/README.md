# Coding Challenge: Data Processing and Plotting

This coding challenge involves a main part and a bonus task: **Data Processing in C** and **Plotting via a Plotting Server**. The challenge is to create a data processing pipeline in C that processes spatial intensity data, removes background noise using a rolling median filter, detects peaks, characterizes the peaks by their center position and half-max-width, and generates binary positional data. As a bonus task, the processed data is then sent to a plotting server via HTTP to create plots of the median filtered data and the binary grating data.

## Data Processing (C)

### Task Description

In the "data processing" part, the objective is to:

1. Read spatial intensity data from the provided `data.txt` file. The data follows the pattern:
   ```
   Intensity[0],Position[0],Intensity[1],Position[1],...,Intensity[n],Position[n]
   ```
   This data represents a 1-d spatial scan of an optical chip's surface. The peaks are generated by light incoupling gratings on the chip.

2. Implement a data processing pipeline in C that performs the following tasks:
   - Background noise removal using a rolling median filter.
   - Peak detection with the ability to detect peaks of different height and width.
   - Characterize peaks by their center position and half-max-width.
   - Generate binary positional data where `1` represents the presence of a grating, and `0` represents the absence of a grating.

### Implementation Details

- The main C program is provided in the `main.c` file. Implement the data processing pipeline within this program.

- Use the Makefile provided to compile the C program.

- Ensure the peak detection method is capable of identifying the positions and widths of light-incoupling gratings.

- The output of the program should be a print of the center positions of the peak as well as their half-max width. You can also plot the intermediate steps for clarity. For this you may use the gnuplot library.

## Plotting Server (bonus task)

### Task Description

The "plotting server" part of the challenge involves:

1. Getting familiar with the code for the HTTP server that expects an HTTP command with plottable data.

2. Implement a mechanism to append your C program so that it takes the filtered data and the grating presence binary data and sends it to the plotting server via HTTP. For this, you might want to use the libcurl library.

### Implementation Details

- The plotting server is set up in a separate project folder and expects HTTP commands for generating plots.

- The C program should be extended to send processed data to the plotting server via HTTP.

- The server saves the generated plots as .png files.

### Sample Client

A sample client binary program is provided to test the HTTP communication with the plotting server.



## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the peak detection method is robust and can handle varying heights and widths of peaks, making it suitable for real-world applications.


- Your solution should be well-documented and include code comments where necessary.

Good luck with the coding challenge!
